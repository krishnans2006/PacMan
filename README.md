# PacMan

*Officially* my first repository on GitHub!

This was a game I made a long time ago, just to pass time during quarantine. A bunch of the game mechanics haven't been implemented yet - this includes Inky's pathfinding, the "Power Pellet", and the ghosts running away when PacMan eats this Power Pellet. However, the game should still "work".

If you're reading this, then you probably don't want to run this game... It's most likely filled with bugs and contains some of the worst code that both you or I have ever seen. If you do decide to look at this code or run it, I apologize in advance.

Hope you enjoy!
